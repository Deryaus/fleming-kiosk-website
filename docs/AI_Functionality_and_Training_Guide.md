### The AI Model

This kiosks AI backend operates off a custom trained AI model based on the gemini-1.5-flash. We picked this base model as it's the best price/efficiency rating model under the Google suite that supports fine-tuning customization. The model is fine-tuned using our custom curated Fleming Q&Q training dataset to instruct the AI on the best method to respond to student questions.
